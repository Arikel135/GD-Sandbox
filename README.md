# GD-Sandbox

This project is a game with procedural generation using the marching cubes algorithm and simplex noise, always striving to be as optimized as possible. It will feature a building system similar to Ark's with snapping, a terrain editor, and tools that allow almost anyone to create their own designs. The main gameplay mode is creative, but there will also be a survival mode. You are free to suggest new mechanics as long as they align with the purpose of the game.
